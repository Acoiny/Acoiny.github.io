        <p>Welcome to my Site! Below there are a few of the projects I've cobbled together over the last couple of years.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Compressing images to a certain size</h2>
        <p>
            I once had to upload many images to a wordpress site that only allowed files of up to 2Mb to be uploaded.
            Because the images I had to upload were all way bigger, I wrote a python script to compress many images
            to a certain size.
            It can be found <a href="https://github.com/Acoiny/masscompress">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Some silly stuff</h2>
        <p>I've created a few very simple web projects that are viewable <a href="dummy">here</a>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A simple <a href="dummy/snake">snake</a> clone</li>
            <li>some <a href="dummy/api">experiments</a> with free apis</li>
            <li>a simple <a href="dummy/timer">timer</a> website</li>
        </ul>
