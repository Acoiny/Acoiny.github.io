    <h1 class="main-heading">Site of <a class="hidden-link" href="https://github.com/Acoiny">Acoiny</a></h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Site! Below there are a few of the projects I've cobbled together over the last couple of years.
    </p>

    <!--<h2 class="section-heading"><a href="https://github.com/Acoiny/masscompress">masscompress</a></h2>-->
    <h2 class="section-heading">Automatic image compressing</h2>
    <p>
        I once had to upload many images to a wordpress site that only allowed files of up to 2Mb to be uploaded.
        Because the images I had to upload were all way bigger, I wrote a python script to compress many images
        to a certain size.
        It can be found <a href="https://github.com/Acoiny/masscompress">here</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- The oth web scraper tool -->
    <h2 class="section-heading">OTH scrape tool</h2>
    <p>
        I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/Acoiny/oth-scrape-tool">simple web scraper</a>, that fetches the
        blackboard ot the OTH Regensburg's IM Faculty.
        It can also fetch the Mensa menu and display it either directly in the terminal or saves it
        to a markdown file.
    </p>

    <!-- Tictactoe clone -->
    <h2 class="section-heading">TicTacToe clone?</h2>
    <p>
        When first trying out <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>, I wrote a simple
        TicTacToe clone in C++. Although... it is not really a clone as it features a tiny
        little twist. To find out what that is, you can check it out
        <a href="https://github.com/Acoiny/Tictactoc">here</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- My testing in webdevelopment -->
    <h2 class="section-heading">Some silly stuff</h2>
    <p>I've created a few very simple web projects that are viewable <a href="dummy">here</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A simple <a href="dummy/snake">snake</a> clone</li>
        <li>some <a href="dummy/api">experiments</a> with free apis</li>
        <li>a simple <a href="dummy/timer">timer</a> website</li>
    </ul>
